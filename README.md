Literally <s>38</s>183 lines of Javascript code to fetch current prices of several (crypo)currencies across exchanges and display possible arbitrage opportunities.

I didn't bother to transpile/polyfill the ES6 script (uses both modern syntax and the Fetch API).
It works like it is on most recent Chrome.
